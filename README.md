# Stochastic Matrix Generator
## Abstract
A stochastic process is a mathematical model that evolves over time in a probabilistic manner. A special kind of stochastic process, called Markov chain, the outcome of an experiment depends only on the outcome of the previous experiment. In other words, the next state of the system depends only on the present state, not on preceding states. Applications of Markov chains in medicine are quite common and have become a standard tool of medical decision making. Markov chains are named after the Russian mathematician A. A. Markov (1856â€“1922), who started the theory of stochastic processes.
